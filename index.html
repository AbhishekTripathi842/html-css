            <p class="white">Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist and academic, was the primary author of HTML, with the assistance
                of his colleagues at CERN, an international scientific organization  <br>
                based in Geneva. Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN. He was named one of Time
                magazine's 100 most important people of the 20th century <br>for this
                accomplishment.<br><br>
                Berners-Lee's browser editor was developed in 1991-92. This was a true browser editor for the first
                version of HTML and ran on a NeXt workstation. Implemented in<br>
                Objective-C, it, made it easy to create, view, and edit web documents. The first version of HTML was
                formally published in June 1993.

            <p class="white">CSS is one of three cornerstone technologies used on the web (the other two are HTML and
                JavaScript). CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets the clues are really <br>
                in the words cascading and style with cascading describing the way that one style can cascade from one
                to another.
                <br><br>

                CSS is used as a way of defining how HTML code is going to look on a website. Whereas HTML (Hypertext
                Markup Language) is used to create content, including<br>
                written text, CSS alters the way a web page will look.
